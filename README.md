## Hi there ğŸ‘‹

<!--
**2253shubham/2253shubham** is a âœ¨ _special_ âœ¨ repository because its `README.md` (this file) appears on your GitHub profile.

Here are some ideas to get you started:

ğŸ”­ I am a recent PhD graduate from the University of Massachusetts Amherst, specializing in Process Modeling, Computational Chemistry, and Catalysis, with a certificate in Statistical and Computational Data Science. I have extensive experience in DFT, MC, and MD simulations for modeling catalytic reactions, analyzing material properties, and optimizing chemical processes.

ğŸŒ± I am currently expanding my expertise in materials informatics, high-throughput screening and machine learning applications for materials and catalysis research to drive data-driven innovation in the field. I am also enhancing my coding and algorithmic problem-solving skills by practicing on LeetCode.

ğŸ‘¯ I am looking to collaborate on computational chemistry projects, materials design, reaction engineering, and process modeling, particularly those involving simulations, molecular-level insights, and data-driven approaches.

ğŸ¤” I am looking for help with exploring industry roles that align with my expertise, transitioning from academia to applied research, and leveraging my skills in computational methods to address real-world challenges in materials science and chemical engineering.

ğŸ’¬ Ask me about catalysis, atomistic simulations, adsorption modeling, high-performance computing (HPC), Python-based computational workflows, and applying data science techniques to chemical research.
